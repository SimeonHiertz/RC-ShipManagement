# RC-Ship Management

This project is a ship management system for rc ships.

The goal is, that any system on board can easily be set up with a microcontroller (Raspi Pico or ESP32) and communicates witht the other systems via CAN-Bus.
Sensors and actuators of a system can be distributed over the CAN, so that each component can be connected to the closest controller.
